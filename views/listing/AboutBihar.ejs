    <section id="history">
        <h2>History of Bihar</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Two of India’s most glorious dynasties, Mauryas(321 -185 BCE) and Guptas (320 to 550 CE) flourished in ancient Bihar region, which was then known as Magadh. The Great King Ashoka (born 304 BCE, died 232 BCE) of Mauryan dynasty whose empire spread across South Asia. He had his capital in Pataliputra that is present Patna. The Gupta period termed as India’s golden age was also based in Magadh and Pataliputra as its capital. Nalanda and Vikramshila were centres of learning established in the 5th and 8th century respectively in Bihar, and are regarded amongst the oldest and international universities, where students from across the world came to study. It is in Bihar that the world’s first democracy was in governance by the Lichchavi(the present Vaishali).</li>
            <li>Bihar has been the cradle of several ancient civilizations and empires. It was the heart of the powerful Magadha Empire, which gave rise to two of India’s greatest religions: Buddhism and Jainism.</li>
            <li>The Maurya and Gupta empires, which originated in Bihar, are considered the golden age of Indian civilization. The region was the center of learning and culture, with institutions like the ancient Nalanda University attracting scholars from across the world.</li>
            <li>The state also holds great religious significance, as it is the place where Lord Buddha attained enlightenment at Bodh Gaya and where Lord Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, was born.</li>

    <section id="spritual">
        <h2>Spiritual Greatness</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The great spiritual way of Buddhism originated and thrived in ancient Bihar, as Buddha attained his enlightenment in Bodh gaya. Therefore the region is full of remains of the monasteries known as Stupa. Jain leader Mahavira also belonged to this region and attained his Nirvana at Pawapuri. Among Hindu religious places Bihar has one of the most prominent pilgrimages at Gaya for imparting offerings to ancestors. Ramayana and Mahabharata, the grand epics of India which are still extremely popular and connected to Hindu religion have numerous tales associated with various places in Bihar. The author of Ramayana, Valmiki also belonged to this region.</li>
            <li>Bihar had also been a hub for the development of Sufism as quite a few of Sufi saints who initiated brotherhood among Hindu and Muslims settled here around the Islamic period. Imam Taj Faqih from Maner, Shihabuddin Pir, Jagiot are few Islamic saints amongst the many. The Qadri order, which is now believed to be one of the chief Sufi orders in the state, had one of its prominent representatives, Syed Muhammad of Amjhar sharif, based in the Aurangabad district of Bihar.</li>
            <li>The Sikh leader the tenth Shri Guru Govind Singh Ji Maharaj was born in Patna in 1660. The Takht Shri Har Mandir Ji Sahib built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh to commemorate his birth place is regarded as one of the five ‘Akal Takht’s by the Sikhs.</li>
            <li>The religious choice is there to take trips on the basis of the Buddhist Circuit, Jain Circuit, Ramayana Circuit, Sufi Circuit, Hindu Circuit, Sikh Circuit etc. for pilgrimage purpose or just to enjoy the sheer beauty of the archaeological remains and the amazing unspoilt natural surroundings of this land.</li>
            <li>During the 12th century CE Bihar suffered aggressive attacks from the Afghan rular Bakhtiar Khilji and all the glorious historical places were plundered by him. Later during the reign of the ruler Sher Shah Suri, the Grand Trunk Road was built.</li>
