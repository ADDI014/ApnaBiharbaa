      "name": "Litti Chokha",
      "description": "Litti Chokha is a quintessential dish from Bihar, reflecting the rich culinary heritage of the region. It consists of two main components: Litti, a round dough ball stuffed with sattu (roasted gram flour) mixed with spices, and Chokha, a mashed preparation of roasted vegetables like brinjal (eggplant), tomatoes, and potatoes. This rustic dish is not only popular in Bihar but also enjoyed in neighboring regions like Jharkhand and Eastern Uttar Pradesh.",
      "HistoryandOrigin": "The origins of Litti Chokha can be traced back to ancient times. It was a staple food for farmers and laborers due to its simple ingredients and long shelf life. Over time, it became a beloved dish across all sections of society. Historically, Litti Chokha was popular among soldiers because it could be easily carried and consumed without spoiling quickly.", 
      "IngredientsAndPreparation": [
        "The preparation of Litti involves two main components: the dough and the stuffing. The dough is made from whole wheat flour, salt, and water. To prepare the dough, whole wheat flour is kneaded with water and a pinch of salt until it becomes soft and pliable. The stuffing for Litti is made from sattu (roasted gram flour) which is mixed with a variety of spices such as ajwain (carom seeds), kalonji (nigella seeds), ginger, garlic, green chilies, lemon juice, and mustard oil. To prepare the stuffing, sattu is mixed with these spices along with finely chopped onions, garlic, ginger, green chilies, lemon juice, and a drizzle of mustard oil. The dough is then divided into small balls, which are flattened, and the stuffing is placed in the center. These are then sealed back into balls. Traditionally, Litti is cooked over an open flame or in a charcoal fire until it develops a charred, crispy exterior, but it can also be baked in an oven for a modern twist.",
        "Chokha, which complements Litti, is made using brinjal (eggplant), tomatoes, and potatoes as its primary ingredients. These vegetables are roasted over an open flame or in an oven until their skins are charred and the vegetables become soft. Once roasted, the charred skin is peeled off, and the vegetables are mashed together. To this mash, finely chopped green chilies, garlic, coriander leaves, salt, and a drizzle of mustard oil are added, and everything is mixed well to create a flavorful and textured Chokha. This combination of the smoky, charred flavor of the vegetables with the fresh, spicy kick of the seasonings makes Chokha a perfect accompaniment to Litti.",
